# Husky Pantry Inventory CS3141 Final Project

We are creating a website that will allow staff of the Husky Pantry to enter and update current stock of the items in the pantry.
This site will display the inventory and possibly nutritional information of the stocked items to students to allow them to plan accordingly with what is available.
